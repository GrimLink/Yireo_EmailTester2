## Unit testing
This extension ships with PHPUnit tests. The generic PHPUnit configuration in Magento 2 will pick up on these tests. To only
test Yireo extensions, you can also run the following:

    ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c ./vendor/yireo/magento2-emailtester2/phpunit.xml.yireo

## Integration testing
See the Magento document for the full procedure.
